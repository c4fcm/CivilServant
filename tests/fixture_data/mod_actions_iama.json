While lifestyle changes like increasing exercise frequency and eating better are important, medication has been scientifically proven to prevent long-term brain damage to young people such as yourself while also preventing relapses of illness. The longer that people delay treatment, the worse outcomes they have.  And life stressors can also make maintaining lifestyle changes harder or trigger relapses of illness, meaning that people may be able to go off of medication but then need to restart it if they begin having severe symptoms (e.g. paranoid delusions, suicidal ideation, etc.).
